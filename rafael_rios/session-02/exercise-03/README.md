# Exercise III

## Add postgres chart as dependency

- Add the postgresql chart as a dependency to the LEMP chart as an optional requirement
- The postgresUser, postfresDatabase and PostgresPAssword variables from the depenedncy should not use the default value used in the postgres chart.

### Tips
- Use the stable/postgres chart from the official catalog: https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/postgresql


### Disclaimer
- I reused an old version of my ex01 where I didn't use the git image, instead I downloaded the apps files through direct url.
