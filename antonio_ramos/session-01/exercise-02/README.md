# Exercise II

## WP Improvements

We will create a more advanced wordpress frontend with 2 version of the image with mariadb backend in namespace exercise-02. Delete name space first to asure it is not createt yet:

```
kubectl delete ns exercise-02
```

All is done in command.bash, execute:

```
./command.bash
```

You must modify your /etc/hosts and add wordpress-exercise-02.com entry with ip from kubectl cluster-info

Wait until all pods are ready:

```
kubectl get pods --namespace=exercise-02 --watch
