# Add postgres chart as dependency
I have created the dependency of the postgres chart by adding it in the requirements.yaml file.The value "condition" make it optional, as default is disconnected.
The attributes of the user, database name and password of postgres have been added to the values.yaml of the LEMP chart, so it have my values and are modifiable. In the postgres Chart only the password is shared by secrets, so it is the only value that I have put in base64.

# Corrections
~~~
installing the third exercise I got this error:

Error: apiVersion "extensions/v1beta2" in lemp/templates/deployment.yaml is not available
Why are you using a different apiVersion for the deployment in this third exercise?
~~~
I made that change in one of the multiple tests. I really do not think it's necessary so I change the API version.

I could not test, but no, it's not functional. I correct it.

I suppose the Postgresql package should not go in the repository. So I add the tgz files in the gitignore list.
