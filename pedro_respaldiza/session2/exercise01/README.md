# Create a LEMP chart
In the deployment of the application I have placed a Nginx container to serve the application and  a PHP-fpm container as a sidecar. The application, as we will see later, will be downloaded from github I have not seen necessary that there has persistence, so the volume that I will use is emtyDir. Presumably, any interesting data will be stored in the database, which will have persistence.

## git
To download the application from github I used an initContainer with an image that supports git. I have forced the return to a previous commit because in this point the application was already complete and thus I do not have the vhost configuration visible in my web server.

## VHOST
The configuration of the vhost is available in a configMap functioning as a volume.

## Mariadb

The database has its own service, its environment variables defined in secrets and its own persistence volume.


I have a problem that makes it not work properly. I can not identify it. I hope to find it.

MOUNT_PATH was a placeholder, you need to update it to the actual mount path in your nginx and php containers
~~~
This is the origin of all my problems. I assumed Vhost as correct and I reviewed everything hundreds of times less that. I'm a bit embarrassed, it was very obvious and you could not guess my route. Obviously I fix it.

what if php is not running in the port 9000?
~~~
At first I did not understand the question. Then I checked and I saw that the port of the php container was not indicated in the deployment of the second exercise. Fix and check the other two to avoid problems.

you could add the plaintext here and then encode in base64 in the secret with a go template function.
~~~
Not only is it a better implementation, in addition it is a good excuse to check the go templates functions. I start working on it.
